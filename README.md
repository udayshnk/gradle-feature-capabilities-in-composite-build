# gradle-feature-capabilities-in-composite-build
This is a sample project which tries to apply feature capablitiy provided by an included build sub project into a project in the main build. 
The base project is created from the sample multi project build generated by gradle init task.

included build has subprojects **utilities**, **list** and **working-app** and the main build has only one sub project **app**.
**working-app** project inside included build is just a copy of **app** project of main build, 
only difference being dependencies declared using module notation instead of project notation in the **app** project.

**utilities** project which is inside included build registers a feature **cachingSupport** which projects **app** and **working-app** tries to consume 
as a dependency using **requireCapability**. 

**Problem**: Feature capability is not working in **app**, though it works fine in **working-app** project.

Running **./gradlew :include-one:working-app:run** works as expected.
Running **./gradlew :app:run** throws an error as it is not able to get the guava jar defined in the cachingSupport capability. 
I tried to even use the dependency substitution rules in the settings.gradle.kts while declaring includeBuild, that too is not working
